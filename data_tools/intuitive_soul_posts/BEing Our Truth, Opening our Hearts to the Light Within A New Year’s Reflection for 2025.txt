As 2025 approaches, we stand at the precipice of a new beginning. The turning of the calendar page offers a chance for reflection, renewal, and a recommitment to our truest selves. As we approach 2025, let us delve into the profound theme of “Being Our Truth, Opening our Hearts to the Light Within.”
As the year of 2024 nears its end, we have looked back and seen that we have shared many different ideas. It is recently that the theme of BEing our Truth and Opening our Hearts has become my mantra for a Beautiful New Awakening.
I feel many changes have happened in the last 4 years since COVID changed the new normal. Let’s use this time to allow that New Normal to encompass our Hearts with Truth.
In a world that often feels chaotic and uncertain, the pursuit of truth becomes an anchor, a guiding light that illuminates our path. Being our truth means living authentically, aligning our actions with our values, and speaking with integrity. It requires courage to shed masks and pretenses, to embrace vulnerability, and to stand firm in our convictions.
Seeing the Truth as it unfolds around the World, we will have many people trying to Tell You Their Truth! We have all observed how the World is encouraged to use Social Media where fake news is supported and even relished as ‘better’ than the News on TV and in paper form.
However, I’m not an advocate of news in general. The same people own most of our News Stations. And Sensationalism seems to be everyone’s goal. The moreSensational and dramatic a situation is, the more likes, trolls, and anger(a podcast done with Tom Campbell on Sensational News and the Truth) – the better – according to the reactions of such media. It is almost like: if it isn’t filled with anger and self righteousness then there is no reason to report it. News tends to trigger emotional reactions, especially around self-righteousness.
It has become increasingly difficult to discern what is truth and what is being interpreted by our own filters. We become fascinated by scandalizing and shocking news; which can lead us down a rabbit hole. As we get lost in everyone’s opinion of what is occurring. Our search for the Truth leads us to distrust our own Intuition and rely on the opinions of others. Believing them to BE Truthful and our own Intuition is dismissed.
Before we move on to Intuition, I would like to briefly discuss the concept of howwe interpret through our own filters. I have spoken many times about how we defer to our filters that have been created by the age of 7. In this older Blog I spoke ofFilters. Our filters are meant to protect us, like our Brain creating the boxes to simplify our thoughts. A filter is exactly the same. If you have a fear about Abandonment, you will see the World through this fear. Every time something happens that makes you feel uncomfortable or have a negative perception that will be seen as Abandonment.
Matt Kahnspoke about us Creating from the Law of Five. We resonate similarly to the top five people in our lives. He states we also create through the five top Stories we tell ourselves. This means that those core beliefs, values and filters we have created – continue to tell the Universe what we are learning. The Universe doesn’t judge us, it is there for us. If we continue to hold onto Abandonment such as “No one ever cares about me”… whatever your top five stories are is where the Universe opts to help you Grow Up from. It is time for us to play a New Game. It’s called Following our Intuition!
Following our Intuition should BE a natural occurrence. But we often misjudge what our Intuition is attempting to show us. We struggle to listen to the quiet voice within. Our natural instinct, to BE filled with our own Unique Essence, is compromised due to the push of fear and negative emotions from ourselves and those around us.
Taking a moment to Consciously step back and assess what we are feeling – and if the emotions are even ours – is necessary.  If this isn’t done then we can’t be in Charge of how we respond. Or even Aware of what our Silent Voice Within is attempting to tell us.
Following our Intuition is a Beautiful Gift that Guides us to BE our Best Selves! When we doubt our Inner Voice, when we Ignore the Quiet Guidance, Fear can overwhelm us and we may not even realize what is occurring. Instead we may have been listening to the projected Fear and Pain that is BEing broadcasted throughout the planet.
Intuition is a Gentle Nudge that Guides us to seek Answers, to See and Feel the Truth, and to Shine a Beacon of LOVE everywhere. However, we can get so caught up in our pain – or the pain of others – and forget we have a direct Connection with the Divine.
When we aren’t Consciously Aware of how we are feeling and interpreting the World, then we are a sponge for the determined darker thoughts and energies around us. We are lost in our regrets of the past or worries about the future.
It is only when we can BEcome fully present in the Now Moment that we have any opportunity to Consciously Choose to acknowledge what is ours and what is BEing projected to us. When we are present, we can choose to Listen to the Silent Voice Within or continue to have our Emotions and Energies thwarted by outside interference.
When we Choose the Now and Listen to that Quiet Voice of our Intuition, it will Guide us. We will feel through the eyes of our Soul/Essence: Knowing that everything is in Divine Order. We can also BE Open to the Gentle Knowing of what is Truth and what is Sensationalized. Maybe even we will Hear the Answers we seek.
Following your Intuition is natural. BEing distrustful of the Gentle Love that flows from your Heart – where your clearest Guidance shines out – is mostly due to a world that favors the Startling and Exaggerated. In a world that values Shocking News and Intelligence over Loving Advice and Joy, we find ourselves holding onto the past and our pain. It is time we Embraced our Intuition and Open our Hearts.
Opening our hearts to the light within is a journey of self-discovery and acceptance. It involves recognizing the inherent goodness that resides within each of us,the spark of divinity that connects us all. When we Open our Hearts, we cultivate compassion, empathy, and understanding, not only for ourselves but for all beings.
This journey is not always easy. We may encounter shadows within ourselves, fears and doubts that threaten to dim our light. But by acknowledging these shadows, we can integrate them into our wholeness, transforming darkness into light.
By observing our fears/shadows we can learn how we have been interpreting the World. We can face and Grow through our shadows/fears. It is only through the acceptance of the Life we have created and where we are on our path – that we will learn to Respond instead of coming from a Reactive place. Reactions are Fear based. Responses come from BEing in Charge: Conscious and Allowing what happens NOT to be interpreted as happening to Us. Things happen and we can choose to react negatively or respond with Grace and Acceptance.
Let us step into 2025, let us commit to being the truth and radiating our authentic selves into the world. Let us open our hearts to the light within, allowing it to guide our thoughts, words, and actions. In doing so, we contribute to a more compassionate, just, and enlightened world.
Here are some practices to support you on this journey:
Our Practices are important to us – in helping us become more Conscious. However, we are often living our lives on autopilot instead.Autopilotmode is a mental state where people navigate their daily lives without conscious thought or deliberate decision-making. In contrast, daily practices are intentional actions that can help people achieve their goals and improve their quality of life.
What Practices you choose are completely up to you. Our individual strengths are complemented by diverse learning styles. Our school system may have only pushed auditory and visual styles of learning. However, we also have empathy – feelings, smell and taste.
Our senses are how our bodies collect and interpret information about the world around us.
Our Intuition or Psychic abilities are connected to our 5 senses: Clairvoyance/Seeing, Clairaudience/hearing, Clairsentience/feeling, Clairalience/smell, Clairgustance/taste. (The last 2 are NOT well known abilities but they are very effective.)  We also have Claircognizance/clear knowing, Mediumship/communication with spirits, Precognition/knowledge of future, and Telekinesis/moving objects with your mind.Wikipediastates there are as many as 24 different psychic abilities.
Then we attempt to interpret our senses. We can interpret through our awareness abilities that may be based on the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual and auric fields.
Let’s offer some examples. I’m an Empath, who feels everything!
Typically, I feel, first, mentally and then I feel spiritually. What does this look like? Mentally means I often feel their thoughts. I know what people are thinking. Which means I can often feel when someone is being less than truthful.  When I feel spiritually, it comes from my Heart. I feel the Heart’s gentle guidance from someone else’s connection to the Divine. If I felt emotionally, I would feel someone’s emotions (which I can also do, but not my primary intuitive ability).
Therefore, when it comes to your practices, it is using this knowledge, gained through such practices, to offer the most effective ways to support your journey. A mental empath would find contemplation a way to calm their thoughts and BE Open to download guidance. A physical clairaudient would probably want to actually sing or play a musical instrument over listening to someone else’s music.
Another effective practice would be to include as many of your senses as possible. Taking a bath with candles, music, chocolate/wine, incense would include all your senses. Taking a walk outside in nature opens your senses too. You may want to listen to the natural sounds; observe people, plants, trees, pets playing; breathe in the fresh air; taste a healthy snack; and Feel your JOY of BEing in nature.
Remember, the journey of self-discovery is a lifelong process. There isn’t an endpoint or a destination to be reached – life is the Journey. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your progress, and trust that the light within you will always guide you home.
As we embark on this new year together, let us join hands and hearts, illuminating the world with our collective truth and light. May 2025 be a year of authenticity, compassion, and profound awakening for all.
From my Heart to YOURS, Happy New Years 2025 ❤️
