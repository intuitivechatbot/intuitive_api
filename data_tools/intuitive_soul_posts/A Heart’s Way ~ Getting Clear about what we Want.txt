In these times of uncertainty and confusion, we are often unclear about what we want. We are, on the other hand, usually very clear about what we don’t want.From the abusive or emotionally unavailable partner, the unfulfilling career or our looming debt. The problem with this is that whatever we focus on, we attract more of into our lives. However, in order to find our path to our heart, so we can align with our Soul’s Purpose and hear its gentle guidance, we need to set clearer intentions and know what we want in our lives.
Main areas of focus:
Look at these areas in your life and create a list of all the things you don’t want. From that list, decide what you do want. Look at the beliefs, fears, thoughts, expectations and anxieties that you continue to hold in these areas. Set your intentions to yourself and the Universe of what you really want.
