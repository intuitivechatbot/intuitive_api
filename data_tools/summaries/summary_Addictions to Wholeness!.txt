Our addictions are what we create to fill a void. When we feel we aren’t enough, that love is conditional, we believe that this is true. What addiction we create is because we feel this emptiness inside us and our ego becomes formed. We choose addictions and dependencies to fill an emptiness that can't be filled because the emptiness doesn't exist. We are ‘whole’ and there is no piece of our spirit that isn't complete.
