If we can look deep enough in our hearts, what we all seek is to be loved and accepted for who we are. Relationships have the ability to show us our shadows, and we can then choose to accept them. When we are in the present, we can be more authentic; this honors our Self and allows for healing to begin. It is also about learning to choose to respond to situations from your authentic self.
