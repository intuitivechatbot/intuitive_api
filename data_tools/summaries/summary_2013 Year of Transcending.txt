2013 is a year where we are to learn to transcend or rise above our lower ego/mind qualities. We can only transcend our lower qualities by first accepting who we are and then rising above this by bridging a connection with our Heart and Soul. Let this year be the year we align with the energies that have gathered to assist us during this time of Ascendance.
