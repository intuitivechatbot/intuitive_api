When we get caught up in the Fear – and fear permeates the collective unconscious of this planet so there’s a lot of fear – we then believe we have to change, fix and heal something within ourselves or someone or situation outside ourselves. We can choose to connect to that Infinite BEing within us that is Whole and Knows it is Perfect just as it is. Things will continue to happen in our lives and our choice is to Remember Who we Are.
