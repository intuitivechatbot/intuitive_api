We can also BE Open to the Gentle Knowing of what is Truth and what is Sensationalized. It is only through the acceptance of the Life we have created and where we are on our path – that we will learn to Respond instead of coming from a Reactive place. Let us open our hearts to the light within, allowing it to guide our thoughts, words, and actions. I feel the Heart’s gentle guidance from someone else's connection to the Divine.
