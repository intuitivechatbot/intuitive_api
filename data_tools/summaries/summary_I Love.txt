Osho: Love isn’t about what we can receive. Love is not about our ego’s desire to control and manipulate the object of our affection. Often our love is conditional on the other person changing, being fixed or accepting that we are “right” and then we want to control how the relationship evolves. The above quote from Osho, describes the type of love that I would like to share with you this Love Month of 2013.
