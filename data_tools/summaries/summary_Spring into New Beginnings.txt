When we work in fear, we work against ourselves and sabotage comes into play. I made a commitment to my health and wellbeing this past week, making 3 decisions to support my Soulâ€™s desire to be healthy. I also know that when I worry about my choice, my motivation comes from a place of fear. If instead, you try to manipulate, control, fix, heal and change something from a state of fear, because it isn't working, then you recreate the very patterns that created the problem in the first place.
