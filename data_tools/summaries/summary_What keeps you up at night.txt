If financial problems keep you awake, it is likely due to projecting fear of the unknown or anxiety about something. Our fears come in many different colors and names, but if you can take it down to one thing, and see the spectrum as love on one side and fear on the other, whatever you name it; it will ultimately be a fear. A great way that I have learned to find solutions is to write it, or think about it prior to going to bed and either allow my dreams or in thein-between hours of the night to come to you.
