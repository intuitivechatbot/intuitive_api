It is time to shift our perspectives of all the changes – and the News that is sensationalized with fear – to shifting our perspective to one of Love, Expansiveness of Spirit and the Stillness. We need to allow ourselves to be guided by Spirit. Spirit is NOT outside us (well technically it is because Spirit is EVERYTHING) but when we focus on Remembering our Power – it needs to come from within us.
