Our initial reaction is unconscious and valid. We then have the opportunity to evolve our consciousness by choosing to rewrite our story. It isn't about what someone else has done to us or that they are trying to hurt us, it is just an event. It is our choice to come from a conscious choosing of our response or adding to our story and letting our unconscious reaction hold us prisoner.
