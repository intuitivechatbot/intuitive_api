How we feel is often tied to the situation we are in or the people we are with. We don’t realize that we can BE in charge of how we ‘show up’ This is our choice. And our choices can only BE conscious when we’re in the Now Moment. I’m Open to the possibilities that We all can make choices that will help us to BE Happy – irregardless of what is happening around us.
