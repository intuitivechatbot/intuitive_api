Our filters impact how we interpret and view the world. I choose to BE aware of the filters that focus on the fears that I have chosen to work through in this life. When we are conscious of our thoughts, feelings and emotions then we can make a choice – do you want to experience the world through your fears or through Love? It also can change our perceptions – we can clearly understand when we are not in Love and it allows us to make achoice – how would we rather BE?
