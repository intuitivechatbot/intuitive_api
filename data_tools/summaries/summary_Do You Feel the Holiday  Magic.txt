When we are truly in the Magic of the Moment we are giving from the heart with no expectations. We often dread the Holidays because we want to change others to BE nicer and to see the problems with our dysfunctional relatives as being outside of ourselves and not able to touch us. We have to nurture this Magic that exists in all of us or else we dull its magnificence. This time of year that magic is strongest and we can touch upon itâ€¦ remember it.
