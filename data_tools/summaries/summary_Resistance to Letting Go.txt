The process of Letting Go is not a new concept as I have read books on a similar theme including “Busting Loose from the Money Game” by Robert Scheinfeld (Wiley 2006) However, when it comes to the Resistance I have been experiencing this month I knew how important a process it was going to be. So, what was I resisting? It seemed that my theme of resistance created a clear path to areas in my life that I haven't been conscious of.
