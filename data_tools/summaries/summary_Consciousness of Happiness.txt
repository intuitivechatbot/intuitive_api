Happiness doesn't come from outside of us – it is a choice – an inner choice. We can make a choice to BE happy, and it is our choice to make. We are in control of our own happiness. It is up to us to make that choice. When all else fails, we can always offer to others our Love by giving and caring about what and where they are on their journey.
