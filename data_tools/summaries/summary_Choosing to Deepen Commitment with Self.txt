If we choose to deepen our commitment to Self, we are acknowledging that our Soulâ€™s growth is crucial to our lives. Being conscious of our actions means asking our self whether we are trying to be a better person because we want others to like us or because we are in service and are acting out of a place of unconditional love. Choosing love, comes from our Heart and the gentle guidance of our Soul.
