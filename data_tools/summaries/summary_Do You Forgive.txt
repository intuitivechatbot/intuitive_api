Our lack of trust, which is accompanied by the feeling of being unsafe, is a deep issue with most of us and it runs to the root of our survival. If we realized just how much harm we do to ourselves by not forgiving and not letting go of our feelings about the situation and/or person – including the Divine – we would never want to withhold forgiveness. Our arrogance in thinking that we are 'right' and others are 'wrong' makes it so difficult to forgive.
