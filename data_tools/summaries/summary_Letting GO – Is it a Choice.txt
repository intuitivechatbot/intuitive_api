I know when my emotions are triggered and I feel uncomfortable. We definitely need to BE more authentic, acknowledging when we are in emotions that are ‘real’ and true is important in BEing authentic. But allowing these fears to rule our lives, to add to our story and create suffering, is a choice. However, offering a way for others to work with ‘letting go’ is not as easy as I would like.
