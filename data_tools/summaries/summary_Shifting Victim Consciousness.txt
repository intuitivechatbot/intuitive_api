Prior to the age of 7 we didn't have a say in how we chose our life. We created a trigger around family and believed we were a victim. If we accept we are a victim then we are letting our fears control and manipulate us. It is always easier to blame others or society. I choose to takeresponsibility for my life and make choices that empower me to Grow Up.
