It is a Choice to BE Positive. Are we conscious of our choices? It is easy for us to get caught up in the world around us and feel we have no choice but to react to what the media has interpreted as the problem. If we are always allowing the Media, friends, family and situations to determine how we feel, then we will not ever BE in charge. We can choose a more powerful and positive choice of LOVE.
