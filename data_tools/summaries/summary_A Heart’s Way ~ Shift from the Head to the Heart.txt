Dalai Lama: We are predominantly in our heads most of the time, reflecting the past, and projecting into the future. Moving from our heads to our bodies, and ultimately our heart, means we are not “doing” but being. We can then respond to situations and people by being loving (for ourselves or others) instead of reacting unconsciously from fear.
