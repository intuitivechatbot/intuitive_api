This year – as it probably should be every year – the theme will be uncovering our ‘true gift’ and we may have many opportunities to rediscover this truth. To fast track this I suggest that you make a list of the areas in your life where you aren’t BEing authentic. These people will be highlighted for you this year so that you can move into your more authentic self.
