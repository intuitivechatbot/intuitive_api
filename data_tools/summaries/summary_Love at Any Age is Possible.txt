During this time I didn’t feel like a relationship was needed – I just wanted to share my life with someone. And that was all it was. I was sure I had been in a Soul Contract with someone – turns out that person just reminded me of my Divine Contract. This reinforces to us – and to our children – that it is better to be in a relationship even if it isn't healthy.
