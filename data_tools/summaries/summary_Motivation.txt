Our Intention and Motivation often are a result of our fears. This means that if we can find a way to BE happy, kind, loving, compassionate or peaceful while ‘doing’ what is required to change then we are coming from a state of BEing that comes from who we are. And since we are often guided by fear first – can you discover a way of being motivated through Love while acknowledging your fears as well?
