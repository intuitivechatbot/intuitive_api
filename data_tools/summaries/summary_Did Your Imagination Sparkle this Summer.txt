I decided not to write about Ken (or Allan for that matter) only because I feel that this movie has a powerful message for Women. ‘Now Feel’ is an example of what we are taught as young girls. Yet for Barbie, who wanted to BE a Real Woman, she was able to Feel and have compassion for the first time. Regardless of what that feeling is, it will help us understand who we are and who we want to BE.
