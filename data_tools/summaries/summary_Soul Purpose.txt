Clear the blocks to being in our Hearts, where we can listen to our intuition and express our Soulâ€™s Purpose. Intuition is a skill that is built through practice. When you can uncover all the beliefs, fears, thoughts, expectations, anxieties, etc., that protect your heart, you will create space for your heart's and soul's full expression. Our hearts will guide us through the stillness where our souls express who we are.
