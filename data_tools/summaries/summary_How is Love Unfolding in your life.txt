The goal is to become aware of what is operating in our unconscious that is sabotaging our best efforts to nurture love. If you can release the ideas you have created around yourself and others, you can be free of the drama within your life. That is why it is so important to be open and allow things to unfold, especially when it comes to love. God is always showing us how we can evolve.
