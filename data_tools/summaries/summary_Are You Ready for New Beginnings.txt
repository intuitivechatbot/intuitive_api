This month I listened to a teleclass given by Derek Rydall. He talked about the ‘Great Reversal’ when we realize that everything we need is within us and whatever is missing is what we are not giving. Giving Thanks, as gratitude is always huge part of transforming who we are to who we want to be. It can be done in many ways, financially, tithing, volunteer work, are some examples.
