When we set an intention we proclaim what we are dreaming about and what we intend to do for this year and beyond. This year, 2020, this new decade, I choose to set my Intention to continue to Grow Up, to become more conscious of how Iâ€™m living my life, to face some of my deepest fears and acknowledge them. I make choices from a place of Love and Acceptance and as a result my choices are aligned with where I see my life going.
