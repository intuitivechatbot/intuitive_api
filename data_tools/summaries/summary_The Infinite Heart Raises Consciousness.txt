My Heart recognizes that my head and gut brains are limited while my Heart is connected to Source and therefore is Infinite. Source, in this context, is the Divine, God/dess, all that is. and it was a 2 on the scale of 1-10. Both are about Infinite Love and Possibilities… Infinite Heart… I think this all is connected. It can happen … just like when my computer is slow and choppy and I have forgotten to be conscious (or aware) that all that's happening is a Microsoft update!?
