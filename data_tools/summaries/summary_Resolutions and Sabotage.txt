When we come from a place of Being we are first connecting with the Infinite and Authentic Self within us. This would be where our little self lives and it is just as important to accept who we are from this ‘little’ place. It is in this state of ‘littleness’, caused by the fears previously hidden, that we have the capacity to make changes to our Inner Being.
