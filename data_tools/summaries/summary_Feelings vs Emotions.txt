Our emotions are something we have judged as either good or bad. Our feelings are not identified or judged as bad or good, they just are. Can we choose to BE happy, or how we want to respond, even if something is appearing to be happening around us – and just BE? To me these are fascinating questions. If we are open to Feeling and committed to BEing in the Now Moment – then we have an opportunity to allow the moment to unfold.
