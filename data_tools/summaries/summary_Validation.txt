The LOA puts the focus on "doing" everything "right" in order to create the change we want to see in our outside reality. We continue to watch our outside world for validation that we are “doing” it right and creating what we desire. What I now am beginning to understand is that we have to change our inner feelings to fill us up and allow our inner world to create our outside experience.
