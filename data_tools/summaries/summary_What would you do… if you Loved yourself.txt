Once I asked myself – and healed some of the reasons I was making poor eating choices for example – ‘if I loved myself, what would I do’, I had other areas come up such as pain that was blocking me from being able to move freely! I realized this ‘pain’ was just another result of where I was sabotaging myself and others to feel safe and supported within. Because the outside world can’t make me feel safe or supported it is my wounded inner child that is manipulating everything outside to show me my inner beliefs and needs! Everything is in our life for a reason. Everything is  in our lives for a purpose.
