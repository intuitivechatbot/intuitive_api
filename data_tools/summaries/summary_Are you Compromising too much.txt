When is compromising the ‘right’ thing to do and when does it corrode who we are and our Soul’s dreams? I think part of the problem is that we aren’t always conscious of our inner values and belief systems. Sometimes it may be about compromising part of what you need for the greater good of the relationship. The other problem is when are we just feeding our ego and its needs? Or opening our hearts and just plain giving?
