The only way the world found a new course to move forward was to forgo our own needs that had become so ingrained within us. As this year comes to an end it is time to Let Go of the fear, hate, and segregation so that we can BE ready for all the Beauty that is coming our way in 2022. This is what I have learned over the past 20 months and as I observe what I've learned I feel positive and at peace knowing that our future will BE joyous.
