Gratitude is primarily an emotional response to our life experiences. If we can be grateful, regardless of whether is something we desire or don't want, then we can truly let it go and lay new pipes. So, what are you grateful for, and can you be grateful not just as a mental exercise, but as a response from the heart and also with your gut whose job it is to protect you?
