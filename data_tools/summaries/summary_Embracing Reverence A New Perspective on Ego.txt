The problem was that we held onto a ‘fantasy’ of this relationship. We can’t rely on what we see or hear as we have already made a judgement. When we are hurt by a relationship, it is our Ego that hurts. This is my NEW Shift in Perspective and an opportunity to Feel Reverence for others. This freed up my Ego to Let Go of the fantasy and BE.
