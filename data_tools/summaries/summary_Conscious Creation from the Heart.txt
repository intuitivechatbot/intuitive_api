Our soul doesnâ€™t care about our bills or our bank account, however, it doesn't want us to live in disappointment either. Instead of focusing on money or career, we need to focus on being aligned with what our soul work is. We see everything outside ourselves through our ego! When time is lost, it is because we were aligned with our soul.
