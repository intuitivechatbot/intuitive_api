Love Heals – and this means that regardless of the Healing I had ALREADY done – there is ALWAYS more to heal. The Universe wants you to Heal through your pain and fear. Your being in that sense of Love will attract more of that Love. The Healing Power of that love is what the Universe wants to Gift you with. Sometimes the purpose of Love in our life is to remind us that it exists.
