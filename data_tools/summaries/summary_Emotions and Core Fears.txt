Emmanuel believes that our emotions are just our mind/egoâ€™s way of distracting us from our deeper core fears that our unconscious believes are too painful. We just need to dive in and allow expression of these fears and to acknowledge that our higher aspects of Self knows that these fears are irrational and NOT truth. The released energy will allow us to be fully conscious of the choices we have made.
