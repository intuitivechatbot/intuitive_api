The media that tells us what we should fear also, as a result, controls us and therefore makes us do, say and think as we are afraid that we won’t get the story of how to live through whatever we're afraid of. Consciousness System doesn't care that we may have made a choice that hurts ourself or others – it doesn't judge us for being manipulated by fear – it just means we will continue on until we can Accept our Choices and make choices that are filled with Love.
