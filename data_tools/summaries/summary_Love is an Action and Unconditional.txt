Love is a given and an action. As long as you DO what I want of you, I will love you. Pluto stepping into Aquarius and the Beginning of the Age of Aquarius, we may BEgin to see a shift from the old paradigm of fear and lack consciousness and move into the fifth dimension of LOVE. It is Your choice how or to whom we Gift our LOVE to… but I encourage you by saying “Let’s GIVE LOVE to all!”
