I have come to realize that it is the Choices that we make that are the most important. We often want a relationship because we donâ€™t want to be alone; or we want a million dollars because we fear lack. Contemplate your motivation when you are not sure and find a way to be positively influenced through Love instead of Fear. I am ready for the feel of spring to return!
