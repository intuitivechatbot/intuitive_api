Many of us are stuck because we can’t imagine or dream – or, for that matter, we have forgotten what Magic feels like. Our Greatest Gift is the Power of Imagination. As you expand your Connection and your energy within your Heart, ask to Remember the Magic. We just can be ourselves and soak in that expansive feeling of knowing that all is working out. That is the MAGIC.
