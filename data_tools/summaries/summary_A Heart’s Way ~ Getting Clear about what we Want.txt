In these times of uncertainty and confusion, we are often unclear about what we want. We are, on the other hand, usually very clear about whatWe don’t want. In order to find our path to our heart, so we can align with our Soul’s Purpose and hear its gentle guidance, we need to set clearer intentions. Set your intentions to yourself and the Universe of what you really want.
