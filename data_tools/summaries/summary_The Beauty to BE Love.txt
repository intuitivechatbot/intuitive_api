The sense of lack of love and the fear of not having what we think is love really has to do with what our Egos want in an attempt to create that ‘image’ of Love that we are searching for. Do we want to continue to hold fear or Let Go, Surrender and choose from within how to BE? We can be in charge of how we shift our reaction of fear to one of LOVE.
