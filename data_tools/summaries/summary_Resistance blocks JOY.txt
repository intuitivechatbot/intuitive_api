Jasper was teaching me a very important lesson and I couldn't easily allow him to make his own choices if I was stuck in thinking this was about me being abandoned. I only hope that I have the strength to remember the love he shared with me over these years as a true blessing and not get triggered by my abandonment issues. I knew Jasper was teaching us all a lesson. If you are experiencing anything you donâ€™t want it won't change unless you shift your focus from that to allowing and receiving this flow of Love, Joy and Well-being.
