Without our Health what good is the rest of the journey? Movement is part of our Growth, it brings us into a state of balance and assists with the natural state our bodies require. Health is maybe not necessary in our Spiritual Growth â€“ because we can even use poor health as something for us to spiritually work with so that we can grow. We take water for granted here in Canada and the US because we have so much fresh water that we forget when we live in cities that we might require more.
