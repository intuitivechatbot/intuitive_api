It is our responsibility to acknowledge the fears that hold us in our patterns. Can we NOT let these fears relate to the ‘stories’ we have within us? Can we remember we aren’t victims of some bully real or imagined and that we can choose how we respond to everything happening around us? I want to take responsibility for whether I am contributing to the fear or radiating Love, Acceptance and Joy.
