The question we should ask ourselves before we do anything is are we responding out of love or reacting from fear? Most often we are reacting from a place of fear. Whether we are the victim or victor, we are separate from God/source because we come to this place through fear. This opens us up to the universal flow which will allow us to express and experience love with others and ourselves.
