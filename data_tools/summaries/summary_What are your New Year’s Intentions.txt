This year I am intending to feel love, above the acknowledgement of all that I have accomplished and created within my life. I invite you to focus your intention on what you choose for your inner life. Instead of weight loss and fitness, what inner feeling are you trying to accomplish? Therefore, following my idea of feelings, donâ€™t think of fitness or exercise as a chore, but as a way to feel better.
