We tend to believe our Happiness is outside ourselves, that it is conditional on things outside of us happening perfectly. We are so caught up in our ego about what is perfect that we forget why we are even here. Keeping our focus within ourselves is the only place we can be in charge of how we feel and be able to maintain the feeling of “happiness” within us. That is Happiness!!
