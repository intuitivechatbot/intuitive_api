Being isnâ€™t something that will make us happy; being comes from an authentic state that is inside us. Often we are trapped in a state where we can't do anything about it. We can only do something about it if we are aware of what we are being trapped in. We are not aware of our current state. Sometimes we are stuck in the past or in the future and we will only be able to do something, because we are totally unaware of what state we are in.
