Our family and friends are where our earliest patterns develop. They create the beliefs, habits and stories that shape the ways we live our lives. Our stories impact all of our relationships. This can impact our intimate relationships in one situation and later in situations with money or career. We are just distracting our awareness from our uncomfortable emotions by convincing ourselves that someone or some situation is causing this to us. We need to rewrite our story.
