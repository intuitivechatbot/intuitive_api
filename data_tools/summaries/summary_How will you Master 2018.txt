Intentions, to me, are about connecting into how we ‘intend’ to feel and come from a state of BEing not doing. It is our fears that will continue to create our addictions to food, sugar, alcohol, smoking, or whatever else we do that we don’t exercise our will over. Our intentions then come from within us and have a sense of Connection to our Inner Self.
