Many sources of the LOA suggest that we can manifest money, cars, houses and relationships and we get caught up in the illusion that this will fill the unhappiness within us. Are we trying to attract/create from a place of fear (eg. if we can come from a soulâ€™s desire to evolve and an acceptance of all that is, not trying to change, do or need)? I believe that our motivation for creating must begin with acceptance of who we are and an understanding from an authentic place.
