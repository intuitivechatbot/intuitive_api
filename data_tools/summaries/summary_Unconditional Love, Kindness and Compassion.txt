Love, Kindness and Compassion are a choice. Over these past Two Years I have seen a lot of pain and anger – thoughts and feelings that have led to Hate and Segregation. The needs we have – no matter what they are – sometimes offered by others that evoke in us nice-feeling emotional responses like having people respect us. These needs are NOT about the person you are in a relationship with another. These are what you have to Let Go of in order to Grow Up and give real Love to someone or something.
