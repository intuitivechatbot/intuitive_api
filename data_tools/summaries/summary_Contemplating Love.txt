This year I have been focusing on the areas I want to fix – before I feel ready to embrace myself and another. My BEing place knows that I no longer want to BE a sugar addict and I am changing this because it is for my Health and Well-BEing. I always say ‘Dream Big and Let the Magic Unfold’ on our Birthdays and this Year My Wish to You is to Never Give Up – it doesn’t matter how old you are or what stage you are at: Love is the Source of Life!
