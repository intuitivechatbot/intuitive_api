We wear masks all the time as we try to be someone otherâ€™s will like and appreciate. We experiment with different masks on occasions such as Halloween, or in alcohol-infused situations, or on vacations. We have more courage, and as a result are more authentic, with these masks on. If fear prohibits us from being Who we are, authentically, and courage is what will eventually allow us to be our authentic self, then why are masks used to make us feel safe?
