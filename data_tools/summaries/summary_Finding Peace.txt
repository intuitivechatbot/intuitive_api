We all have experiences, challenges, choices and personal stories that we have judged and continue to relive. One of our challenges with BEing in the Flow is our ability to Love and Accept ourselves for who we are. Do not try to deny or sugar coat things â€“ simply make peace with who You are. Send love and compassion to all those parts of your Self now! Can you connect to your Inner Self through your senses?
