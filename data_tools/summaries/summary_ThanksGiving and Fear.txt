We need to stop believing we are victims. We are not victims, we are survivors. We can be anything we want to be. We have to let go of the pain – the fear – of being the victim. It’s the only way we can change the world. We expect our Thanksgiving gatherings to be filled with Love, Acceptance, and Happiness despite the fact that our only memories of this occasion are memories of an earlier time.
