When you think about love, what is it you desire most? Dare to Dream about all the beauty that a relationship can hold. We fear the dream, because we believe it means that we will have to leave the person we are with. A relationship will push you to be the best you you can be. Itâ€™s not about the person in your life, but how they make you feel.
