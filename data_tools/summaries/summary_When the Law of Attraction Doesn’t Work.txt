"The biggest part of my journey has been to understand my own growth and spiritual evolution" "We see these people, or mirrors, as separate from ourselves and therefore canâ€™t take 100% responsibility for our growth and what is in our lives" "What we really need is to be in the Now moment and focusing on opening our hearts and accepting and loving who we are"
