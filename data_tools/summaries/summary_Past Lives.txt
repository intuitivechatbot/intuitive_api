Past Lives: Why are they fleeting memories; why we chose to forget them; is there anything significant to learn by them; or are they just a distraction? I wonder if our past lives assist us to Grow Up towards Love or distract us from living this life because they trigger our fears or possibly overwhelm us. This is all wrapped around our purpose: we are here to make a difference and to grow up towards Love.
