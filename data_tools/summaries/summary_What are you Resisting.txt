When we have resistance to doing anything, it would benefit us to examine what we are resisting and where the belief is interfering with our intentions. Often our resistance is a gift to understanding what areas of our lives we want to transform. We can accept that there is a reason that we are where we are right now, and find a way to be comfortable with where and who you are in this moment.
