We don’t have to like what happened or even like the person who triggered us or possibly even hurt us – but I suggest we grow towards love as we need to be able to accept that the people who – or events that – may have negatively impacted us are the result of people who may have had their own fears and pain. We just have to remember that when someone acts out it isn't personal. This is Acceptance but Acceptance teaches us that that is NOT love.
