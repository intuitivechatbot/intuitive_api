Love is about letting go of all of our fears, beliefs and idiosyncrasies that we often blame ‘others’ for. Love is about taking responsibility for all of who we are so that we can love others as well as ourselves. And lastly, our search for love has a motivation that we need to identify and understand. It may be self-confidence or it may be that we are learning to love ourselves.
