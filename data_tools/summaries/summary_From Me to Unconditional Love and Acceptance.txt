This month I focus on choosing not to be triggered by myself or others this month. By the age of seven we do not have an emotional understanding of our experiences. We experience this event as the same ‘story’ we have created. To evolve towards love we must consciously understand and see when we want to first react and then take charge of our personal view of the situation.
