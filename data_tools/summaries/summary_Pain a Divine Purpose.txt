In the midst of my suffering, I do feel powerless, separate and victimized (aka abandoned), which only adds to my mental, emotional, physical and spiritual dis‚Äùease. So I wonder if not everything and everyone in our life is our Divine Purpose. Not to change or fix, but to let us see what our choices are, so, we may make new choices from a different perspective.
