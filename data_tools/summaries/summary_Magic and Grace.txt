Grace is the Magic of love, compassion, and generosity. It dulls every time we give our fears more power than the “magic” within us and our lives. Magic and grace exist, we just have to hold it within our hearts. To know that beyond the fear that we can get stuck in, there is Divine Consciousness; Grace that breathes through our lives, is our Home.
