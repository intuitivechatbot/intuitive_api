If we can understand that EnJOYing is an active choice, then we can consciously make an effort to BE JOY no matter what is happening in our lives. We are now faced with a decision and choice: do we accept our choices – regardless of whatever the choice is and whether or not it has the impact we want it to have on our bodies and lives? You see, Spiritual Growth isn’t always easy or pain free.
