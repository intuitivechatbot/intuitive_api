How we choose to ‘show up’ to the world is a choice. By choosing Fear we change what happens outside in our world. Maybe believing that only fear motivates change is how some may see it. I don't adhere to that philosophy and I believe that no matter what is happening outside of us we have the choice to choose how we respond.
