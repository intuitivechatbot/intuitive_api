The holiday season is about Giving, not getting. When we hold our beliefs and fears from the place of a core wound, we react instead of respond. Think of all the beautiful gifts that you have to offer the people in your life and your community. The gift of the Holidays is that the Magic of this time is strong, and we have an opportunity to connect into this beautiful vibration of giving more easily.
