How well we understand ourselves and how we learn, will assist us in understanding how we receive information and guidance. I have expanded my understanding of how our intuition works and therefore our ability to receive information from Soul. Once you understand yourself and can identify your primary ways of receiving guidance, you then have to practice. My belief is that more and more people are clairsentient and claircognizant. Physical people feel through their bodies.
