Life as we know it – is different now. Or will take this time, since we have indefinite time available to us now, and make changes to our New Normal. We know that fear is what blocks us from Living our Best Life. This time that we are currently in appears to be about nesting, resting, and exploring new opportunities to nurture ‘US’ So we have more choices to BE in our inner worlds.
