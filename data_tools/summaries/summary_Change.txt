I’ve coined April as “The Month of Change” This is to allow our new beginnings to move us forward. Change is the one constant force in our lives, yet we still fear it and resist it. Sometimes change happens to us, if we don’t take action or miss the signs. I often feel it is easier if we initiate the change than have it forced upon us.
