I found it difficult to not focus on the pain or weight loss (things clearly outside of me) when I still could feel pain and my weight wasn't dropping as quickly as I wanted. I uncovered incredible stories and decisions I had made in the past that continue to affect me! I knew that my focus on validating my outside world by needing my symptoms to be alleviated was definitely a part of the problem.
