My Soul has been guiding me through my beliefs, through my perceptions of my experiences, and through my understanding of who I am at a Soul level. I needed to experience all this abandonment and betrayal for me to come into alignment with my Soul’s guidance. Even my recent discomforts with my health have been to remind me that this journey isn’t to change what happens but to embrace what I have been learning and give it a voice.
