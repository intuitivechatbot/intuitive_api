When we are stuck in the past or worrying about the future, other peopleâ€™s energy can sneak into ours without us even being aware of it. People who come into your energy field with their anger, sadness, pain and fears can influence you if you are not aware they are there. Once you have established what feeling is yours and what is anothers then you can focus on Rediscovering JOY and the Magic of the Season.
