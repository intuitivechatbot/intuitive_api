We need to be gentle on ourselves so that our story of guilt, shame, anger, and fear doesn’t overwhelm us. I also find that if I can bestillso that I can discern what is happening around me, those things that are distracting me from BEing Present, this somehow gets me thinking about and inside the present moment. And we can find ourselves taking the small steps – even the ones that help us to be fully present – to have more fun.
