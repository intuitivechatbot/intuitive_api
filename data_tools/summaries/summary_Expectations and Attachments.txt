When we have expectations about our attachments to outcomes over which we have no control – and we know it – we tend to be fearful of what we have created or what we are creating. The only way to change this to allow us more opportunity to experience more of those perfect moments is for us to become more aware of ourselves and of what is happening around us. We can choose to do the same thing over and over and hope we have a different outcome (definition of ‘insanity’) or we can choose small shifts that will allow us to let go. What choices do you make?
