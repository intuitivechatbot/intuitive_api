Grounding ourselves and finding balance within the chaos that exists on this planet, and perhaps in our lives, is Key to living a mindful life. Being in a state of balance is about more than our energy; it is about finding a way to harmonize all areas of our lives. To be grounded, first you must be present in your mind and body and from that place of inner balance, connect in with the earth.
